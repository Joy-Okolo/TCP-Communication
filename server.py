# === server.py ===
# This is the server program that accepts multiple client connections
# It handles file uploads, file downloads, and executes commands like mkdir, mv, dir remotely

import socket  # Import socket library for network communication
import threading  # Import threading to allow multiple clients to connect at the same time
import os  # Import OS library for file handling (check files, write files)
import subprocess  # Import subprocess to run system shell commands (mkdir, mv, dir, etc.)

# === Configuration ===
HEADER = 64  # Define how many bytes to use to specify the length of a message
PORT = 5050  # Port where the server will listen for client connections
SERVER = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
# Automatically find the server's IP address on the local network
ADDR = (SERVER, PORT)  # Create a tuple combining server IP and port
FORMAT = 'utf-8'  # Encoding format for messages (text communication)
DISCONNECT_MESSAGE = "!DISCONNECT"  # Special message used to indicate client wants to disconnect

# === Create TCP Socket ===
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)  # Allow reuse of address
server.bind(ADDR)
